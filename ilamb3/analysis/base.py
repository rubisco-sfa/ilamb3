    The ILAMB analysis base class.

    An abstract base class (ABC) in python is a way to define the structure of
    an object that can be used in other parts of the system. In our case this
    means that in order for your analysis to be compatible in the ILAMB system,
    you need to write a class that has *at minimum* the following member
    functions with their arguments and return values.

        Your analysis must be able to provide a list of variables that are to be

        variables are to be used. The assumption is that the variables you
        require are part of a historical-like experiment. If your analysis
        requires variables from different experiments, this function can also
        return a dictionary of lists where they keys are the experiment names

        The work of your analysis must accept a reference and comparison

        you want to generate scalars and maps/curves for plotting. Once
        complete, ILAMB would like results in a pandas dataframe (for scalar
        information) as well as a dataset for the reference and comparison.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ref : xr.Dataset
            The reference dataset.

            The comparison dataset.

        The function which creates plots from analysis intermediate results.

        ILAMB will run your __call__ method over all comparisons and build up a
        dataframe of scalars and a dictionary of intermediate result datasets.
        We will pass these into this function where you can generate plots.
        Instead of saving them directly here, place the into a pandas dataframe
