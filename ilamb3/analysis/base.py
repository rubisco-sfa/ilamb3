    The ILAMB analysis base class.

    An abstract base class (ABC) in python is a way to define the structure of an object
    that can be used in other parts of the system. In our case this means that in order
    for your analysis to be compatible in the ILAMB system, you need to write a class
    that has *at minimum* the following member functions with their arguments and return
    values.

        """
        Return the variables used in this analysis.

        Your analysis must be able to provide a list of variables that are to be used.
        This is so we can query models with your function and learn which variables are
        to be used. The assumption is that the variables you require are part of a
        historical-like experiment. If your analysis requires variables from different
        experiments, this function can also return a dictionary of lists where they keys
        are the experiment names from which the lists of variables are required.

        The function which performs the analysis.

        The work of your analysis must accept a reference and comparison dataset. The
        user will need to package everything that each needs for the analysis upon
        submission. Inside this function you can use whatever you want to generate
        scalars and maps/curves for plotting. Once complete, ILAMB would like results in
        a pandas dataframe (for scalar information) as well as a dataset for the
        reference and comparison.
